How to Implement the Loan Function
----------------------------------

Step 1: Initialize all bank values to a starting point
  * This will require setting the values using the yaml-cpp file
  * Values will be created and then set into the yml database 
    * values will then be updated whenever users take loans and/or make deposits

Where is it that we want to create a menu to start the loan process?
