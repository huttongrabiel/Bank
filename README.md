# Bank
We Buildin' A Government Monetary Transaction Unit

# Background
Was joking around in the car on a roadtrip a built a like 30 line 'banking system' that was
basically just a calculator that did adding and subtracting. So now I am actually
trying to make my own bank system. 

# Usage
IDK.. Clone it and make terrible financial decisions with no repercussions

# Why YAML?
I work closely with yaml in my DevOps Internship and I am trying to get better 
using it. At the same time I want to write some in CPP so I used the yaml-cpp
library to access and modiy the yml file that will hold all the user information.

'''
users:
  identifier:
    stuff : thing
