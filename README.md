# Bank
We Buildin' A Government Monetary Transaction Unit

# Background
Was joking around in the car on a roadtrip a built a ~30 line 'banking system' that was
basically just a calculator that did adding and subtracting. So now I am actually
trying to make my own fictional bank system. 

# Usage
IDK... Clone it and make terrible financial decisions with no repercussions?

# Why YAML?
I work closely with yaml in my DevOps Internship and I am trying to get better 
using it. At the same time I want to write something in C++ so I used the yaml-cpp
library to access and modiy the yml file that will hold all the user information.

```bash
users:
  identifier:
    stuff : thing
    stuff : thing
```

# WARNING
It does not work at all right now, don't even bother cloning it.
